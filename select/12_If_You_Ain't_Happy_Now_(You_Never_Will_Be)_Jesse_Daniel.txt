If you ain't happy now
You never will be
Livin' for tomorrow
Is an hour that you never see
The secret that you look for
Right under your feet
If you ain't happy now
You never will be

Can't see the forest
When you're in the trees
So just step outside and look around
To see what I need
And if you're still lonely
It'll be okay
Don't let those lies of yesterday
Spoil your life today

If you ain't happy now
You never will be
Livin' for tomorrow
Is an hour that you never see
The secret that you look for
Right under your feet
If you ain't happy now
You never will be (oh!)

You can have a big house
With an ocean view
You can pay someone to do
The things you don't want to
One thing you can't buy
Is peace of mind
Who knew the best that life could give
Was the hardest thing to find

If you ain't happy now
You never will be
Livin' for tomorrow
Is an hour that you never see
The secret that you look for
Right under your feet
If you ain't happy now
You never will be

If you ain't happy now
You never will be
