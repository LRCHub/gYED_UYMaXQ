In this hole That is me
The dead are rolling over
In this hole Thickening
Dirt's shoveled over shoulders
I feel it's me
So overwhelmed
Oh there's precious
little rising
My life overturned
What dare the despair?
All these scars
keep ripping open
Peel me from the skin
Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now
Tear me from the bone
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now
In this hole That is me
A life that's growing feeble
In this hole So limiting
The sun has set, all darkens
Buried underneath
And slip off the wheel
Eternal pathways to contention
Peel me from the skin
Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now
Tear me from the bone
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now
I am Happy
I am Happy
Are you feeling happy
In this hole That is me
Left with a heart exhausted
What's my release
What sets me free
Do you pull me up
Just to push me down again
Peel me from the skin
Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now
Tear me from the bone
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now
Peel me from the skin
(Peel me from the skin)
Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now
Tear me from the bone
(Tear me from the bone)
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now
Does it make you happy
Are you feeling happy
Are you fucking happy
Now that I'm lost
left with nothing?
Does it make you happy
Are you feeling happy
Are you fucking happy
Now that I'm lost
left with nothing
